CMSE 410 Semester Project 

This project aims to assess how different FDR methods impact GWAS findings. After replicating the BH-based results from Scepanovic et al., I will implement and compare alternative FDR techniques—such as Bonferroni, Benjamini-Yekutieli, and the Storey-Tibshirani q-value approach—on the same dataset. I will visualize and compare the sets of significant variants under each method using Manhattan and QQ plots.
